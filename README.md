# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling of customer churn for a company, focusing on understanding which customers are likely to leave (churn) and why.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric that can significantly impact a company's revenue and customer engagement strategies. This project aims to identify the key factors that contribute to customer churn and develop predictive models to identify at-risk customers.

## Business Questions

## Data Analysis

Geographic Analysis of Churn:

France has the highest customer base but the lowest relative churn.
Germany shows a disproportionately higher churn rate despite a smaller customer base.
Churn Rate by Gender:

Male customers have a higher churn count compared to female customers.
Correlation Analysis:

Significant factors include Age and Geographic location, particularly in Germany.
Strong positive correlations indicate older customers and those in Germany are more likely to churn.
Negative correlation between account balance and product holdings with churn suggests that customers engaged with multiple bank services and maintaining higher balances are less likely to leave.
